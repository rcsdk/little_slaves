# 🏔️ Mountain Shelter

Mountain Shelter is a dual-host, self-healing, zero-cloud local AI ops system for high-performance LLM workloads.  
It runs across two battle-hardened Linux machines:

- **Phantom (Galaxy Book2 Pro):** CPU-centric orchestrator, lightning-fast NVMe, Intel AVX2, iGPU OpenCL experimental.
- **Shadow (Acer Aspire VX15):** GPU-centric workhorse, NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti, CUDA 12.x stack, AVX2, legacy HDD bottleneck (noted for masochists).

This setup enables mirrored, hardware-optimized task allocation, robust telemetry, and modular extensibility.  
**No cloud. No SaaS. No external dependencies beyond what you control.**

---

## ☄️ Architecture Overview

**Mirrored, Hardened Layout**
```
/home/rc/.mountain_shelter/
├── agents/         # Multi-agent definitions, logic, roles
├── dashboards/     # Config files for monitoring UIs
├── logs/           # System and app logs (symlink to .llm_logs if needed)
├── models/         # GGUF, Transformers, custom quantizations
├── runtime/        # Cache, vector DBs, temp inference state
├── scripts/        # Diagnostics, installers, watchdogs
├── venv/           # Python environment (host-specific)
└── shared.cfg      # Shared config: ports, hostnames, etc.
```
Rsync, SSH orchestration, agent model-swapping: **Seamless. Both hosts always in lock-step. No excuses.**

---

## 🧠 LLM Stack: Advanced, Not Consumer-Grade

### Unified Python Environment

- **Location:** `/home/rc/.mountain_shelter/venv/`
- **Provision:** Use `mamba` for speed/channel control. Fallback: `venv + pip` (if you enjoy pain).
- **Core LLMs:** `torch`, `transformers`, `sentence-transformers`, `llama-cpp-python`
- **Frameworks:** `langchain`, `faiss-cpu`/`faiss-gpu`, `uvloop`, `httpx`, `openai`
- **Support:** `aiohttp`, `psutil`, `flask`, `typer`, `py-cpuinfo`, `rich`
- **Host Roles:**
  - **Phantom (Galaxy):** Orchestrator, CPU-based inference, agent logic, iGPU offload (OpenCL/SYCL) for experimental parallelization.
  - **Shadow (Acer):** Heavy GPU inference (CUDA, `llama.cpp -DLLAMA_CUDA=ON`), token cruncher.

> **Reproducibility:** `env.yaml` or `requirements.txt` is generated, version-locked, and baked in for deterministic deployments.

### Kernel & Hardware Tuning

| Host    | Kernel         | Rationale                                |
| ------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Galaxy  | XanMod Edge    | Low-latency, Intel tuned, AVX2 unlock    |
| Acer    | Liquorix       | GPU latency, gaming/AI optimized         |

**Reality check:**  
If your kernel isn’t custom-tuned or at least running XanMod/Liquorix, you’re not serious about low-latency LLM ops.

- **CPU Governors:**  
  - **Galaxy:** Must be set to `performance` (`powersave` = wasted silicon).
  - **Acer:** Already `performance` (as it should be).
- **PCIe Bottleneck (Acer):**  
  - GTX 1050 Ti must run PCIe Gen 3 under load. Stuck at Gen 1? You’re bottlenecked and wasting your dGPU.

## 🤖 LLM & Agent Strategy

### Stack Choices

| Component         | Galaxy Book2 Pro (Phantom)                              | Acer Aspire VX15 (Shadow)                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| LLM Engine        | `llama.cpp` (AVX2, OpenCL/SYCL for iGPU, experimental) | `llama.cpp` (CUDA, AVX2, full GPU offload)                   |
| Primary LLM       | Mistral-7B (Q4_K_M/Q5_K_M)                             | Mistral-7B (Q3_K_M/Q4_K_S/Q4_K_M)                            |
| Utility LLM       | Phi-3-mini (Q4_K_M/Q5_K_M)                             | Phi-3-mini (Q4_K_S, fits 4GB VRAM)                           |
| Embeddings        | `sentence-transformers` (CPU)                          | `sentence-transformers` (GPU via PyTorch CUDA)                |
| Vector Store      | `faiss-cpu`/`LanceDB`                                  | `faiss-gpu`                                                  |
| Agent Framework   | `CrewAI`, modular Python/Bash agents                   | `CrewAI`, Python, and direct shell hooks                     |
| LLM Server        | `llama.cpp --server`                                   | `llama.cpp --server`, OpenAI API compatibility               |

**Notes:**  
- Quantizations fit RAM/VRAM realities.
- CPU+GPU hybrid inference on Acer for max throughput.
- Galaxy is orchestrator/agent brain; Acer is LLM muscle.

## 📊 Monitoring, Telemetry & Self-Healing

### Netdata — because Grafana is overkill for this.

- **Deployed both hosts:**  
  - Galaxy = controller (federates dashboards)
  - Acer = satellite
- **Zero config:** Just works. Real-time web UI, auto-detects everything worth monitoring.
- **Metrics:**  
  - CPU, GPU (nvidia-smi, iGPU), RAM, disk I/O, PCIe sensors, service/process health.
  - LLM-specific: Token/sec, model load times, live heatmaps.

**Custom Watchdogs:**  
- `phantom-watchdog.py`: Telemetry, alerting, dead-man switches for CPU/RAM/thermal.
- `shadow-control.sh`: GPU runtime manager, hooks to Netdata for LLM-specific telemetry.
- `llm-heatmap.json`: Netdata plugin for visualizing model stress/load.

**Redundant sensors and alerting:** If it’s about to melt, you’ll know before the silicon does.

---

## 🛡️ Security & Reliability

- **No consumer-grade anything:**  
  - Hardened Linux, minimum viable external dependencies.
  - Automated patching (kernel, drivers, LLM libs) via scripts—not left to chance.
- **Mirrored infrastructure:**  
  - Full rsync-based snapshot and failover.
  - Agents, models, configs always in sync.
- **Zero SaaS/cloud exposure:**  
  - All orchestration, vector DBs, and UIs run locally, air-gapped capable.

## 🏆 Comparative System Analysis (TL;DR)

| Feature                | Acer VX15 (Shadow)            | Galaxy Book2 Pro (Phantom)    | Verdict                          |
|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **LLM Inference Speed**| 🏆 GPU-accelerated (if PCIe OK)| CPU-optimized, iGPU optional  | Acer wins for raw LLM speed      |
| **Storage**            | HDD (🐌, upgrade to SSD ASAP!)| NVMe SSD (🚀)                  | Galaxy wins on responsiveness    |
| **CPU**                | 7th Gen, AVX2, 4c/8t         | 12th Gen, AVX2, 12c/16t (P+E) | Galaxy wins for agent logic      |
| **RAM (Idle)**         | ~12.7GB                      | ~10GB                         | Both fine, Acer has slight edge  |
| **Setup Pain**         | Needs driver wrangling, PCIe test| Simple: CPU focus, iGPU optional | Galaxy is easier to get running  |
| **Risk Factor**        | PCIe stuck at Gen 1 = useless GPU| CPU governor left at powersave| Both fixable with root access    |

**Bottom Line:**  
- **Acer = LLM muscle** (if PCIe sorted, else it’s a paperweight).
- **Galaxy = Orchestrator/agent HQ** (don’t forget to fix the CPU governor).
- Both designed for failover and continuous ops. Pick your bottleneck: speed (Acer+SSD) or agility (Galaxy).
